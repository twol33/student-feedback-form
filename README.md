# Project Name

Student Feedback Form

## Description

Duration: 2 days

The task was to create a feedback form for current students to refelct on their schedule for the day.

The reflection consists of 4 forms with a question tied to each form. 

The user is able to input a number range of 1-5 (1-least confident) for the first 3 forms and a comments section as the last form. 

After all four forms are complete there will be a summary of their reflection and if the summary is statisfactory, they can submit their review.

# Required Steps

Create a database "prime_feedback";

The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. 

The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. 

We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,

1. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
2. Run npm run server in your terminal
3. Run npm run client in your terminal

The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Built with:

 - React
 - VSCode
 - Postico
